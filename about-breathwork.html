            <div class="techniques">
                <h3>Deep abdominal breathing</h3>
                <p>This technique uses a long, deep breath. As you breathe, you can visualize your breath filling up your body. Your belly and chest should both expand when you inhale. When you exhale, your chest relaxes, and your navel pulls back in toward your spine. This type of deep breathing tells your body to relax.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="techniques">
                <h3>4-7-8 breath</h3>
                <p>This technique adds in counting beats as you breathe in and out as a way to quiet and focus your mind. Breathe in for four beats, hold your breath for seven beats, and then exhale for eight beats. A longer exhale encourages you to completely empty your lungs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="techniques">
                <h3>Alternate nostril breathing</h3>
                <p>Start with your right thumb applying pressure to your right nostril. Breathe in using only your left nostril and hold your breath as you switch sides. Release your right thumb and use your right index finger to apply pressure to the left nostril as you exhale through the right nostril. Pause, take another deep breath in, and then alternate again. This type of breathing technique helps encourage balance in your mind and body.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="techniques">
                <h3>Breath of fire</h3>
                <p>This is a more advanced technique. When you inhale, your abdominal muscles are relaxed. When you exhale, engage your core to help push the air out of your body. This breathing technique may take some practice. Once achieved, it helps to provide a sense of steadiness.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="techniques">
                <h3>Holotropic breathwork</h3>
                <p>It’s best to have an experienced instructor help you practice this technique. The idea is to achieve a continuous inhale and exhale pattern with no pause in between. This type of breathing floods your body with oxygen and renews your cells.</p>
